<h3 #duration>
  Duration
<p>
  While active, skills that last for multiple turns are indicated by an icon above their user, along with their remaining duration. Status effects and traps that are applied every turn by a skill have their duration represented by â€¢ instead of 1, to indicate that they will be refreshed next turn.
<ul><dl>
  <li #instant>
    <dt>
      Instant
    <dd>
      Instant skills have immediate effect and do not last for any turns.

      Action
    <dd>
      Action skills are actions carried out by their user for multiple turns. If the user is stunned while performing an action skill, the action will temporarily cease its effects. It will resume once the user is no longer stunned. If the number of turns is not specified, the skill lasts indefinitely.
  <li #control>
    <dt>
      Control
    <dd>
      Control skills are "grab"-like skills that last for multiple turns and require a continual connection between the user and the target. The skill takes effect every turn for some number of turns. The skill is canceled if the user is stunned or their target becomes untargetable due to invulnerability, death, etc. If the number of turns is not specified, the skill lasts until canceled.
  <li #ongoing>
    <dt>
      Ongoing
    <dd>
